I reside in Georgetown, TX. I'm working fully remote for a Utah-based, healthcare startup: Rivet.

At Rivet, my primary work involves Node.js, Bazel, TypeScript and occasionally Go and Python; with a focus on Developer Experience, Build Systems, Internal Tools, and Infrastructure.

I'm currently exapanding my Computer Science major with more college-level courses, with the goal of working on lower-level systems as a career.

I'm trying to track my progress using [notion.](https://seed-session-edb.notion.site/9706eb0f1e3d494aba9e5ef2ab684ce7?v=6590f35a9cff4bc7a8fb0380cfe0ca4a) Check out my post on [Self Guided Operating Systems.](/posts/self-guided-operating-systems/)

In my world I'm:

- Getting married (+ honeymoon)
- About to move to Katy, TX
- Rewatching Star Trek: Voyager
- Hyperfixated on \<special interest\> (it's always changing, checkout the cycle below)
- Learning hand embroidery, cross-stitching

My cycle of special interests:

- Graphics Programming
  - Game Development
- Operating Systems **_<-- we are here_**
- Distributed Systems
- FOSS
