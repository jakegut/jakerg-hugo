I've been interested in learning more about Operating Systems for quite some time now, so much so I've considered going to grad school to learn more about it. However, I think I can make do with resources available online. I just won't have anything to show for it besides personal projects, as opposed to a post-undergraduate education.

\## Information Overload

With so much information online, it's overwhelming shifting through it all and deciding which resource is the "best". When trying to learn more about anything Computer Science related, I like to see if there's a book on the subject. So, I looked up some threads about books to learn more about Operating Systems and I came across a few books:

* ["OSTEP"](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) -- Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau
* [The "dinosaur" book](https://codex.cs.yale.edu/avi/os-book/OS10/index.html) -- Operating System Concepts by Silberschatz, et al.
* [Modern Operating Systems](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Tanenbaum-Modern-Operating-Systems-4th-Edition/PGM80736.html) by Tanenbaum

Now this isn't a complete list
