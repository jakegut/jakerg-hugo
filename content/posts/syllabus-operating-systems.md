I've been interested in learning more about Operating Systems for quite some time now, so much so I've considered going to grad school to learn more about it. However, I think I can make do with the resources available online. I just won't have anything to show for it besides personal projects, as opposed to a post-undergraduate education.

## Information Overload

With so much information online, it's overwhelming shifting through it all and deciding which resource is the "best". When trying to learn more about anything Computer Science related, I like to see if there's a book on the subject. So, I looked up some threads about books to learn more about Operating Systems and I came across a few books:

* ["OSTEP"](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) -- Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau
* [The "dinosaur" book](https://codex.cs.yale.edu/avi/os-book/OS10/index.html) -- Operating System Concepts by Silberschatz, et al.
* [Modern Operating Systems](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Tanenbaum-Modern-Operating-Systems-4th-Edition/PGM80736.html) by Tanenbaum

OSTEP was the most mentioned book and is even featured on [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#operating-systems). OSTEP has individual chapters for free online and has [multiple projects](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects) to do. The dinosaur book has projects as well, but what I like most about OSTEP's set of projects is that about half of them involve extending the xv6 kernel.

I'm glad that I found a book to read and reference to, now I have to find out which parts are relevant. While I eventually want to go through all of it, I'd like some direction on which parts I need to read the most to kickstart my learning. Luckily I found the author's course website where he uses OSTEP as the textbook: [UWM CS-537: Intro to Operating Systems](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Spring2018/). This course includes a lot of useful information such as a calendar, projects, and even videos which is a rare find on course websites.

While the course website is packed with information, I'm often at a loss (dare say, overwhelmed) whenever I visit it. The calendar portion is a bit too packed for me and I often click around and go back and forth between the videos, projects and reading.

The main reason I'm creating this post is to hopefully organize and extend upon the course in a format that I can follow step-by-step and can easily come back to. I'll create a personal syllabus that first includes the Intro to OS course, some more readings and projects from OSTEP and finally another book to apply my knowledge to.
